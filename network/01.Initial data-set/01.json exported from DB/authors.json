Since July 2009 he has been a faculty member with the department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University, where he is currently a Professor. His research focuses on ultra-low-power integrated circuits and systems with an emphasis on sensing applications. Of particular importance is the use of emerging devices for the creation of functionally-diverse systems and the use of advanced signal analysis frameworks for low-power inference on embedded signals. On the circuit level, his focus spans low-voltage digital logic and SRAMs, low-noise analog instrumentation and data-conversion, and integrated power management.",

      "bio": "With process technologies scaling into the nanometer regime, the underlying implementation technology increasingly affects architecture and circuit design. We must adapt and reinvent current designs to circumvent technology constraints (e.g. interconnect delay, device leakage, soft-errors, device mismatch) and to target emerging applications (e.g. sensor networks, computational biology). The key near-term challenge is to build compute systems that can efficiently achieve high-performance, yet remain economically feasible, general-purpose, and easy to program. In the long-term, with CMOS scaling approaching fundamental limits, the challenge will be to build efficient, high-performance, reliable computation systems from technology building blocks that may be radically different from those we use today.\n\nMy primary research interest is the circuit design of efficient, high-performance digital blocks (i.e. memories and functional units) in future generation technologies. Further, I'm interested in building tools to export VLSI-level design information and constraints to architectural-level design.",

I lead the FORWARD Group, which is part of the larger Data and Information Systems Laboratories, at the CS department of UIUC. Our research overall aims at bridging structured and unstructured big data--- to bring structured/semantic-rich access to the myriad and massive unstructured data which accounts for most of the world's information. Therefore, our research spans across data mining, data management/databases, information retrieval, machine learning, with current efforts focusing on interactive data management, entity-centric Web search and mining, social media analytics, and social network mining. As our objectives, we aim at developing novel systems, principled algorithms, and formal theories that ultimately deliver real world applications. As our approaches, we seek to be inspired by and learn from the data we are tackling-- i.e., we believe the key to tame big data is to learn the wisdom hidden in the large scale of the data.",

      "bio": "I am an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering and a graduate field member of computer science at Cornell University. My research group is part of the Computer Systems Laboratory, and we broadly work on energy-efficient parallel computer architecture for both high-performance and embedded applications. I am also interested in parallel programming methodologies, hardware specialization, interconnection networks, VLSI chip-design methodologies, and the intersection between computer architecture and future emerging technologies. Building prototype systems is an integral part of my research, as this is one of the best ways to validate assumptions, gain intuition about physical design issues, and provide platforms for future software research. \n\nMy research has been recognized with several awards including a Cornell Engineering Research Excellence Award (2015), an AFOSR Young Investigator Program award (2015), an Intel Early Career Faculty Honor Program award (2013), an NSF CAREER award (2012), a DARPA Young Faculty Award (2012), and an IEEE Micro Top Picks selection (2004). My teaching has been recognized with a Michael Tien '72 Excellence in Teaching Award (2013) and a James M. and Marsha D. McCormick Award for Outstanding Advising of First-Year Engineering Students (2013). \n\nPrior to joining Cornell University, I received my Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 2007 to 2009, I was a visiting scholar in the Parallel Computing Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley; I received an M.Phil. in engineering as a Churchill Scholar at the University of Cambridge in 2000, and received a B.S. in electrical engineering as a Jefferson Scholar at the University of Virginia in 1999.",

I was lucky to get an excellent undergraduate education at I.I.T Kharagpur, where my B.Tech. (Hons.) final project and thesis advisor, Prof. P. Dasgupta taught me early concepts in logic design, switching theory and programming. Later, I was lucky to become a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I received my M.S. and Ph.D degrees in electrical & computer engineering. I am grateful for the excellent training and friendship that I received there from my M.S. advisor (Prof. Jacob Abraham) and my Ph.D co-advisors: the late Prof. Bob Rau and Prof. Ed Davidson (who now enjoys a retired life at Ann Arbor, MI). I am particularly interested in microprocessor architectures - with a focus on high performance, energy efficiency and reliability (fault tolerance). When I joined IBM Research in May of 1983, I was lucky enough to have the privilege of working on a pioneering RISC super scalar processor R&D project. The project was managed by Dr. Tilak Agerwala (who retired from IBM in 2013 - as VP of Systems) and mentored by IBM Fellow and ACM Turing Award winner, Dr. John Cocke. I was fortunate to start my career at IBM as one who was given the \"timer\" development job in that now-famous Cheetah/America RISC processor project. (The term \"timer\" was an IBM term that referred to a cycle-accurate simulator). This role allowed me to develop a deep understanding of how: (a) processor microarchitectures were implemented; (b) how to optimize the super scalar pipelines for performance; and (c) how to leverage compiler optimizations to extract performance from super scalar processors. Later, I worked on performance optimizations related to IBM's mainframe processors - in particular the IBM S/390 VF (vector facility). Since 1999 or so, my focus has been on processor/system energy efficiency and resilience.",

      "bio": "My research focuses on programming new cellular behaviors by designing and embedding synthetic gene networks that perform desired functions in single cells and multi-cellular environments.  We genetically engineer a variety of cell types including bacteria, yeast, and mammalian stem cells.  This nascent field of Synthetic Biology holds promise for a wide range of applications such as programmed tissue engineering, environmental biosensing and effecting, biomaterial fabrication, and an improved understanding of naturally occuring biological processes.\n\nThe construction of de-novo genetic circuits begins with the assembly and characterization of genetic parts, or building blocks.  We have assembled a library of genetic components that regulate transcription, translation, phosphorylation, and synthesis of and response to signaling molecules such as acyl-homoserine lactones in bacteria and cytokinins in Eukaryotes.  We then combine these parts into various network topologies that elicit new behaviors in a programmable fashion.  In single cells, we have constructed transcriptional cascades and other network topologies with feedback and feed-forward motifs.  We have shown theoretically and experimentally that these networks can perform digital computation, attenuate gene expression noise, or exhibit analog programmed functions such as pulse generation.  Through the construction and analysis of such fundamental network motifs, we aim to demonstrate sophisticated programmed control over gene expression as well as improve our quantitative understanding of naturally occurring complex gene networks. \n\nAnother major emphasis is engineering synthetic multicellular systems through the integration of intracellular circuits with cell-cell communication mechanisms (e.g. lux and rhl quorum sensing systems).  Beginning with simple sender-receiver systems, we have built a variety of more sophisticated multicellular interactions for coordinated cell behaviors.  One such system is the pulse generator where sender cells communicate to nearby receiver cells, which then respond with a transient burst of gene expression whose amplitude and duration depends on the distance from the senders. In another system, receiver cells have been engineered to respond to cell-cell communication signals from senders, but only if the signal concentrations fall within prespecified ranges.  We demonstrated experimentally how a multicellular system that consists of several different detection thresholds can generate a variety of interesting spatial patterns (shown in the figures below).  In a third system, cells have been engineered to \u201cplay\u201d Conway\u2019s Game of Life, where cells live or die based on the density of their neighbors.  This system exhibits complex global emergent behavior that arises from the interaction of cells based on simple local rules.  We are currently building a variety of other multicellular systems in bacteria that have interesting spatiotemporal dynamics.  Finally, we are also implementing synthetic gene networks and artificial cell-cell communication in mammalian stem cells in order to control the spatiotemporal expression patterns of cell fate regulators, with novel applications in programmed tissue engineering.",

Informally, that means my students and I have fun solving mathematical puzzles to show that hardware and software designs do what they were intended to do. Real programs and hardware designs such a huge number of possibe inputs and behaviours, that there's no way we can test all of them by running the software, simulating the hardware, or running the hardware in the test lab. This is why bugs show up in real products. If you like solving mathematical puzzles, or if you've think formal verification could help you with your designs, click here.\n\n\nMy teaching\n\nI enjoy teaching. Students are what make a university such a great place. I'm constantly inspired and challenged by the students at UBC, especially the ones that I get to know in the classes that I teach. I've taught courses at UBC on computer architecture, programming languages, automata theory, asynchronous design, and discrete mathematics. This year (2015/16), I'll be teaching a graduate introduction to formal methods and our undergraduate course on parallel computing. In 2015/16 Term 2, I'll also be teaching a graduate version of the parallel computing course, CS 521.",

The research and education part of this description remains the same but now with the department of Computing at Imperial College in London.\n\nMy research interests include computer systems design, advanced computer architecture and micro-architecture, reconfigurable computing, hardware/software co-design, Embedded Systems, VLSI design, and computer systems testing.\n\nCurrently my research focuses on dynamic techniques to manage contemporary distributed memory hierarchies and heterogeneous multicore systems, application specific acceleration, and low overhead reliability techniques. All the above topics are in the context of the emerging CMOS technology trends when the quality of the available transistors is deteriorating while their quantity on a single chip keeps scaling up. These trends combined with the severe power dissipation constraints of digital logic require novel, holistic hardware-software approaches and expose new challenges to computer systems designers. A possible simplification of the problem is how to transform the available transistor quantity into affordable quality (in respect to power dissipation per unit area).\n\nIn the past I worked for many years in the computing systems industry in Bulgaria and the Netherlands. Since March 2002 I joined TU Delft where I graduated more than 50 Master students and 8 PhDs (there are few more PhD and MSc students to go in Delft).",

      "bio": "David Blaauw received his B.S. from Duke University in 1986 and his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois, Urbana, in 1991. From 1993 until August 2001, he worked for Motorola, Inc. in Austin, TX, where he was the manager of the High Performance Design Technology group. Since August 2001, he has been on the faculty at the University of Michigan where he is currently a full Professor. His work has focused on VLSI design with particular emphasis on adaptive and low power design. \n\nIn the area of adaptive design, Blaauw introduced a new approach called Razor in 2003 (MICRO) where processor chips automatically tune their frequency or supply voltage to the point of failure, thereby eliminating wasteful design margins. By adding low-overhead delay error detection and correction circuits, the Razor approach allows the processor to be tuned to the point where failures start to occur (which are automatically corrected) indicating that all margins are removed.  As the chip experiences different environmental conditions, such as temperature and supply voltage changes or aging effects, Razor automatically tracks the innate performance of the design by maintaining a low error rate.  Razor was implemented in several test chips showing as much as 50% power reduction and 30% performance improvement and has spawned significant further research in related approaches by industry and academic researchers. In addition, Blaauw has investigated other areas of adaptive design, such as methods for in situ detection and management of oxide-breakdown and NBTI degradation.  \n\nIn the area of low power design, Blaauw introduced the concept of the \"energy optimal voltage\" (Vopt) in 2004 (DAC) together with his student Bo Zhai and colleague Dennis Sylvester. At the Vopt voltage, energy per operation reaches a minimum and further reduction of the supply voltage increase leakage energy more quickly than dynamic energy reduces. Typically, Vopt lies below the threshold voltage, leading to the need for subthreshold design.  Blaauw's and Sylvester's research team spend the following years developing ultra-low power sensor systems using subthreshold design. this lead to numerous publications, ranging from new, ultra-low voltage SRAM design, subthreshold processor architectures, timers, new subthreshold power gating methods, low power radios, power management, DC-DC conversion, analog to digital conversion (ADC), level shifters, and energy harvesting. This work culminated in 2011 (ISSCC) in the publication of in the worlds first mm-scale, complete sensor node with a volume of 1.5mm-cube, including radio, battery for 1 month of operation, pressure sensor, processor, memory, and solar cells which extend operation indefinitely. They continue the development of ultra-small sensor nodes for new applications domains through new circuit techniques. \n\nAt the high end, Blaauw has applied low power techniques to throughput limited computing found in data centers.  Together with Prof. Mudge and Sylvester, he introduced the concept of \"near threshold design\" (NTC) in 2007 (ISLPED). For throughput constrained, parallelizable applications,  NTC finds that the optimal trade-off between the energy efficiency gained through low voltage operation and the associated performance loss lies at a supply voltage that is ~200mV above the threshold voltage.  This has lead to new investigations by their research team into low voltage design for chip multiprocessors, including new high radix routers to connect chip multiprocessors with memory, and investigation into 3D design.",

The lab engineers microfluidic devices and BioMEMS (Bio Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) to study neuroscience, genetics, cancer biology, systems biology, and biotechnology. These miniaturized Lab-on-a-chip tools enable us to study biology in a unique way unavailable to conventional techniques. Applied to the study of fundamental biological questions, these new techniques allow us to gather large-scale quantitative data about complex systems. Microfluidic devices are especially suitable for solving these problems because of the many advantages associated with shrinking the devices down to a scale comparable to typical biological systems. Furthermore, unique phenomena at the micro and nano length scale, such as enhanced surface effects and transport phenomena, can be exploited in designing novel techniques and devices.\n\nIn neuroscience, we are interested in how the nervous system develops and functions, and how genes and environment influence behavior. In cancer biology, we are interested in the roll of extra cellular matrix and soluble factors in cell migrations. In cancer therapy, we are interested in signal transductions for adoptive transfer. For systems biology, we are interested in large-scale experimentation and automation, and applications in neuroscience and cell biology. In general, we bring together molecular and genetic techniques and the micro devices to further our understanding of the complex biological systems. We make micro devices to investigate molecular events and signaling networks, cellular behavior, connectivity and activities of populations of cells, and the resulting complex behaviors of the animals. The ultimate goal is to bring new technologies to understand natural and dysfunctional states of biological systems and ultimately bring cures to diseases.\n\nDr. Lu holds a Love Family Professorship.\n\nLearn more about Dr. Lu's research.",

I am also a Professor in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Before joining ODU, I was an Alfred and Helen Lamson Endowed Professor at the Center for Advanced Computer Studies (CACS), University of Louisiana at Lafayette (UL Lafayette). I received the B.S. degree in scientific instruments from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1996, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and Ph.D. degree in computer science from the State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo in 2000 and 2002, respectively. Being a professor is the greatest job. I get to explore interesting ideas, interact with brilliant scholars, and mentor young people. My research focuses on networked cyber-physical systems for security, safety, and emergency management applications, where the devices are often light-weight, with extremely limited computing power, storage space, communication bandwidth, and battery supply. I received NSF CAREER Award in 2004, UL Lafayette Distinguished Professor Award in 2011, and IEEE Percom Mark Weiser Best Paper Award in 2018.",

There he worked on high field transport in MOSFETs and later in DRAM development and manufacturing. In 2001, he joined the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA, to lead a group for novel devices and applications. He was responsible for the exploration of device concepts for future technology nodes and new concepts for memory and logic circuits, including 3-D integration, early FinFET work, and the exploration of carbon nanotubes for VLSI circuits. He also was active in CMOS integrated silicon photonics to provide high-bandwidth low-cost links for future compute systems. He is currently responsible for novel technologies for neuromorphic computation with emphasis on exploring memristive elements (such as PCM, RRAM, FeRAM, etc.) in neural network arrays. He is the author of a text book on transport physics and author/coauthor of more than 150 publications.,Dr. Haensch was awarded the Otto Hahn Medal for Outstanding Research in 1983.",

His first two degrees were from Caltech and his PhD in electrical engineering is from Stanford. He is a Fellow at Cadence Design Systems (San Jose, California), where he is responsible for the software architecture of digital integrated circuit design tools. Lou Scheffer is the author of a significant paper called Aliens can watch 'I Love Lucy' published in Contact in Context. Conventional wisdom says that aliens might detect our TV signals, but will not be able to decode them. In contrast, Lou argues that \"this view considerably underestimates the technologies that aliens might employ. By looking at likely technical improvements -- better receivers and feeds, bigger antenna, signal processing, and perhaps stellar focusing -- any civilization that can detect our radiations might well be able to decode it as well. Thus aliens can form their impression of Earth from 'I Love Lucy'.\" \n",
