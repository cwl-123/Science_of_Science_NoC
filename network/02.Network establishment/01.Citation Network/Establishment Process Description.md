Citation network establishment process description:

1. First, run the matlab program named citation_network.m and get the nodes.csv and edges.csv  that can be used as gephi input.

2. Use edges.csv and nodes.csv in `result (gephi import file)` to input the Gephi analysis software to get the citation network. 
3. Through gephi, we get some results, such as: clustering coefficient, network diameter and other parameters and community discovery of the NoC citation networks, the results are saved in `gephi results`.
